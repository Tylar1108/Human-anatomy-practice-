while drawing recently i came to know 
how bady human anatomy proportions were
at least in digital artworks ðŸ˜…
i felt like i needed to improve om that 
aspect of my artworks and so decided to
practice drawing human figures but in my own
original character's outfits
so, gathered some references and got sketching
in the end, to add a little more interest 
to it, i painted the background as well
hope you like it, artwork in repository
